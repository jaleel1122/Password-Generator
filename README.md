# ðŸ”‘ Password Generator (React.js)

A simple **Password Generator App** built with React.js.  
The main goal of this project was to practice **intermediate React hooks** (`useEffect`, `useRef`, `useCallback`) and implement a **copy-to-clipboard feature**.


## ðŸ”— Live Demo

##  Features
- Generate random **secure passwords**
- Customize password length
- Include/exclude numbers and special characters
- **Copy to clipboard** functionality
- Responsive and easy-to-use UI


## What I Practiced
- **useEffect** â†’ update password when options/length change
- **useRef** â†’ reference the password input to copy text
- **useCallback** â†’ memoize functions for performance
- Handling real-world UX (clipboard access)
- **Responsive design** â†’ made the app mobile-friendly 


## ðŸš§ Future Improvements
- Add **password strength indicator**
- Better styling with Tailwind or CSS frameworks


This is a **practice project** while learning React.
